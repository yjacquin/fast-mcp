## [1.7.0] - 2025-10-04

### Added

- **MCP Protocol 2025-06-18 Support**: Updated to the latest Model Context Protocol specification
- **OAuth 2.1 Resource Server Implementation**: Full OAuth 2.1 compliance with support for:
  - JWT token validation with JWKS support
  - Opaque token validation with custom validator
  - Scope-based authorization (tools, resources, admin)
  - Audience binding (RFC 8707) for confused deputy prevention
  - Protected Resource Metadata endpoint (RFC 9728)
  - WWW-Authenticate headers in error responses
  - HTTPS enforcement (configurable per environment)
- **StreamableHTTP Transport**: Modern unified transport replacing legacy HTTP+SSE with:
  - Single `/mcp` endpoint for both requests and streaming
  - Improved session management with cryptographically secure session IDs
  - Rack hijacking support for efficient SSE connections
  - DNS rebinding protection
  - Protocol version header validation
- **Fiber-Based Concurrency Support**: Automatic async mode detection with seamless fallback:
  - Auto-detection of Fiber scheduler (Falcon, async gem)
  - Graceful fallback to thread-based concurrency (Puma, Unicorn)
  - Manual override capability via `async_mode` option
- **Enhanced Metadata Handling**: Tool and Resource `_meta` field support with:
  - Reserved prefix validation (`mcp:`, `mcp-`)
  - Metadata sanitization and merging
  - Format validation
- New transports: `OAuthStreamableHttpTransport`, `AuthenticatedStreamableHttpTransport`
- Comprehensive OAuth documentation suite (6 new guides, 4,000+ lines)
- New examples demonstrating OAuth, StreamableHTTP, and authenticated transports

### Changed

- Protocol version updated from `2024-11-05` to `2025-06-18`
- Base transport abstraction introduced for common functionality
- Server metadata response now includes formatted `_meta` field

### Deprecated

- Legacy `RackTransport` (HTTP+SSE with separate endpoints) - still functional but migration recommended
- Old path configuration (`path_prefix`, `messages_route`, `sse_route`) in favor of unified `path` parameter

### Fixed

- Audience binding validation logic in OAuth resource server

### Dependencies

- Added: `jwt` gem (~> 3.1) for OAuth 2.1 support

### Migration Guide

See [docs/migration_guide.md](docs/migration_guide.md) and [docs/rails_migration_guide.md](docs/rails_migration_guide.md) for detailed migration instructions from legacy transports to StreamableHTTP.

- Extended Rails autoload paths for tools and resources directories
- Sample generator templates for resources and tools
- MCP Client configuration documentation as reported by [#8 @sivag-csod](https://github.com/yjacquin/fast-mcp/issues/8)

### Improved

- ‚ö†Ô∏è [Breaking] Resource content declaration changes

  - Now resources implement `content` over `default_content`
  - `content` is dynamically called when calling a resource, this implies we can declare dynamic resource contents like:

  ```ruby
  class HighestScoringUsersResource < FastMcp::Resource
  ...
    def content
      User.order(score: :desc).last(5).map(&:as_json)
    end
  end
  ```

- More robust SSE connection lifecycle management
- Optimized test suite with faster execution times
- Better logging for debugging connection issues
- Documentation had outdated examples

## [0.1.0] - 2025-03-12

### Added

- Initial release of the Fast MCP library
- FastMcp::Tool class with multiple definition styles
- FastMcp::Server class with STDIO transport and HTTP / SSE transport
- Rack Integration with authenticated and standard middleware options
- Resource management with subscription capabilities
- Binary resource support
- Examples with STDIO Transport, HTTP & SSE, Rack app
- Initialize lifecycle with capabilities
- Comprehensive test suite with RSpec
