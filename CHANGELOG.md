## [1.0.0] - 2025-03-30

### Added
- Rails integration improvements via enhanced Railtie support
- Automatic tool and resource registration in Rails applications
- Extended Rails autoload paths for tools and resources directories
- Sample generator templates for resources and tools
- MCP Client configuration documentation as reported by [#8 @sivag-csod](https://github.com/yjacquin/fast-mcp/issues/8)

- Fixed bug with Rack middlewares not being initialized properly.
- Fixed bug with STDIO logging preventing a proper connection with clients [# 11 @cs3b](https://github.com/yjacquin/fast-mcp/issues/11)
- Fixed Rails SSE streaming detection and handling
- Improved error handling in client reconnection scenarios
- Namespace consistency correction (FastMCP -> FastMcp) throughout the codebase

### Improved
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [Breaking] Resource content declaration changes
  - Now resources implement `content` over `default_content`
  - `content` is dynamically called when calling a resource, this implies we can declare dynamic resource contents like:
  ```ruby
  class HighestScoringUsersResource < FastMcp::Resource
  ...
    def content
      User.order(score: :desc).last(5).map(&:as_json)
    end
  end
  ```
- More robust SSE connection lifecycle management
- Optimized test suite with faster execution times
- Better logging for debugging connection issues
- Documentation had outdated examples

### Added

- Initial release of the Fast MCP library
- FastMcp::Tool class with multiple definition styles
- FastMcp::Server class with STDIO transport and HTTP / SSE transport
