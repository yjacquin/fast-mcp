### Pull Requests

1. Create a new branch for your changes:

   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```
2. Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive commit messages
3. Add or update tests as necessary
4. Update documentation as necessary
5. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```
6. Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository
7. Describe your changes in the pull request description
8. Link to any related issues

Pull requests should:

- Address a single concern
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as necessary
- Follow the style guidelines
- Pass all tests and CI checks

## Style Guidelines

### Code Style

Fast MCP follows the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/). We use Rubocop to enforce these guidelines. To check your code:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop
```

To automatically fix some issues:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop -a
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - ‚ú® `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature
  - üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - üìö `:books:` when adding or updating documentation
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è `:recycle:` when refactoring code
  - üß™ `:test_tube:` when adding or updating tests
  - üîß `:wrench:` when updating configuration files

### Documentation

- Use [YARD](https://yardoc.org/) for code documentation
- Update the README.md and other documentation as necessary
- Add examples for new features
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

- `main` is the default branch and should always be deployable
- Feature branches should be created from `main` and merged back via pull requests
- Release branches are created for each release and named `release/vX.Y.Z`
- Hotfix branches are created from the release branch and named `hotfix/vX.Y.Z.N`

### Release Process

1. Update the version number in `lib/mcp/version.rb`
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with the changes in the new version
3. Create a release branch `release/vX.Y.Z`
4. Create a pull request to merge the release branch into `main`
5. After the pull request is merged, create a new release on GitHub
6. Build and publish the gem to RubyGems

## Community
